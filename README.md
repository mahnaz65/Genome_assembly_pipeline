# Genome_assembly_pipeline
To learn the steps of genome assembly using Hifiasm  

# Raw data

I created a subsample from HiFi PacBio read that I have. With these subsamples, you should be able to run the analyses on your local computer.
As you can see in the names of the samples, one of them is smaller. you can try which one that works on your local computer. Please download the files from the links below:

## Introduction
Generally, there are three steps to generate the assembly file. First is generating the initial assembly, then scaffolding, and then polishing. 
1. [Part 1: Generating the initial assembly](part1/)
2. [Part 2: Scaffolding](part2/Scaffolding.md)
3. [Part 3: Polishing](part3/Polishing.md)


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Ra√∫l Wijfjes (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0806-2911) for teaching me this pipeline and for sharing his documentation and steps, which I used as the basis for this project.
